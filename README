An X11 cursor theme based on the original X11 cursor font!

This theme also adds symlinks for the new GNOME cursor names.

Created to allow Firefox 123 and other Gtk 3 software to work without
the Adwaita icon theme package.

To enable, clone or copy this directory to ~/.icons.

Add this to ~/.Xresources:

	Xcursor.theme: cursorfont

Add this to ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini and ~/.gtkrc-2.0:

	gtk-cursor-theme-name=cursorfont

And run this command:

	gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme cursorfont

Good luck!
